    <p>Hi Tushar,</p>
	<p>Welcome to the CJ Network!</p>
	<p>Thank you for signing up for a CJ publisher account and for applying to the TripAdvisor Commerce Campaign affiliate program!</p>
	<p>We&#39;ve put together a short checklist of steps for you to quickly get set up and start earning money for the content you create. Even though you joined through a specific advertiser, with your new publisher account you can also develop affiliate relationships with any of the thousands of other advertisers in the CJ Network.</p>
	<h3>Save Account Details</h3>
    <p>Hang onto the following account details to reference later:</p>
    <p>Email: tushar@simplifytrips.com</p>
    <p>Client ID: 4916842</p>
    <p>You created your password when you signed up. You can change your password at any time by navigating in your CJ account to <i>Account</i> > <i>Users</i> and clicking the <i>Change Password</i> button.</p>
    <p><b>Go to:</b> <a href="https://members.cj.com/member/login">Login</a></p>
    <h3>Complete Your Network Profile</h3>
    <p>Advertisers view your profile to understand whether your are a good fit for their affiliate program. It is comprised of two parts:</p>
	<ul>
        <li>General Description - Complete a detailed description of your business in your own words.</li>
        <li>Promotional Methods - Select all the promotional methods you&#39;ll use to promote advertisers&#39; products or services.</li>
	</ul>
    <p>Our Network Quality team reviews network profiles to ensure that everyone is being transparent and fair, so be as accurate as you can.</p>
    <p><b>Go to:</b>  Account > <a href="https://members.cj.com/member/4394327/accounts/publisher/profile.cj">Network Profile</a></p>
    <h3>Submit Payment and Tax Information</h3>
    <p>Once you start earning commissions, CJ can&#39;t pay you until you provide all of your payment and tax information. Avoid delays in getting paid by filling this information out as soon as you can, and being as thorough and accurate as possible.</p>
    <p><b>Go to:</b> Account > <a href="https://members.cj.com/member/4394327/account/publisher/settings.cj">Administrative Settings</a></p>
    <h3>Add Your Websites</h3>
    <p>Add the websites you will use to promote advertiser&#39;s offers within the CJ network.  You may add or remove websites at any time.</p>
    <b>Go to:</b> Account > <a href="https://members.cj.com/member/4394327/accounts/publisher/sites.cj">Websites</a> <br/>

    <h3>Check Your TripAdvisor Commerce Campaign Application Status</h3>
    <p>Most advertisers review publisher applications individually so you may not know immediately if you&#39;ve been accepted by TripAdvisor Commerce Campaign. If you have, you will receive a second email welcoming you to their program. Review your application status by viewing your advertiser relationships by &#34;status.&#34;</p>
    <p><b>Go to:</b> <a href="https://members.cj.com/member/4394327/accounts/publisher/advertisers/findAdvertisers.cj">Advertisers > By Status</a></p>


    <h3>Find Partners</h3>
    <p>Search for advertisers whose brands or products you want to promote on your website. Some advertisers only work with certain types of publishers, so be sure to review the advertiser detail page before applying to an advertiser&#39;s program.</p>
    <p><b>Go to:</b> <a href="https://members.cj.com/member/4394327/accounts/publisher/advertisers/findAdvertisers.cj">Advertisers</a> | <a href="https://members.cj.com/member/contactSupport.cj?id=4776811"> Learn More</a></p>

    <h3>Track Content</h3>
    <p>Add tracking code for your partners&#39; content to your site. There are lots of ways to do this, including pulling individual link code, but the simplest and most effective way is to use our Link Tools. You can utilize our Deep Link Generator or Deep Link Automation which can automatically monetize all hyperlinked content instantly.</p>

    </p>
    <h3>Automate</h3>

Or, access our APIs where you can automatically retrieve links or search for advertisers. Ask a Client Support representative or search the Support Center to get started.</p>

 Dear Tushar,
 Thank you very much for posting your Business Development (Sales)
internship requirement on Internshala.
 The post is still under review and not yet made live because -



 It is an output driven performance based internship i.e Rs 200 /Sale. We
insist on a basic fixed stipend for in-office requirements and the rest
could be performance-based. This ensures that the basic expense of the
intern is taken care of. Please revert with the minimum assured stipend that
you would be willing to pay to the hired intern.



 Please feel free to get in touch on +91 9650196253 for any queries or
 assistance.

 We look forward to hearing from you.
 Many thanks,
 Anamika Singh Manager- Employer Relations+91 9650196253Internshala

Dear Mr Sandeep Jain, 

Greetings of the day... 

As discussed with you during our F2F interaction about
simplifytrips.com, we would like to have you on board. As there is zero
commission structure and no sign-up charges with us, you have the
opportunity to increase your business. I would also like to remind you
about your consent in signing up with us during our meeting. We have
started our campaign on social media platforms and require more listings
to reach out to people in a very effective manner, as our business model
is based on the number of listings done with us by tour operators

Moreover i would like to ask for a favor from your end to allow me to
represent a ppt about simplifytrips to all the tour operators operating
from Delhi during any general meeting/event/gathering of tour operators
or any event of IATO. For this acti will be very thankful to you. 

Kindly revert, I am eager to hear from your end. 

With Best Regards 

Tushar Choudhary

hi Tushar, 

 I am co-founder of Nativebag.in, with rich prior experience in Amadeus
Software Labs and have keen interest in Travel & related businesses.
I would like to present you with a partnership proposal for Nativebag.in
with SimplifyTrips.com. 
Nativebag specializes in specialties (food/gourmet/arts/handicrafts etc)
of every place in India. 
We also supply GI Tagged products (like a patent to certain section of
manufacturers/sellers) of India. 
We are also affiliated with TEXTILES-MINISTRY OF INDIA THROUGH IHB
(INDIAN HANDLOOM BRAND) and their authorized e-commerce partner channel.

PROPOSAL:
Based on the travel location searched/booked by your customers, we could
offer specific specialty products of the location as content in your
website.
We could offer our products either as a separately bookable content like
'Local Specialties' (or) along with any bookable content on your site.
Technically we can work it out based on the scenario.

Whats in it for SimplifyTrips.com?
a) Customer satisfaction as they would get access to specific
products/specialties where they travel. 
b) Souvenir is a very unorganized sector with lots of adulteration and
duplicate issues. With GI and select authorized sellers from our side,
this can be averted. This gives an edge over other players in the OTA
industry.
c) Completes the trip from a nativity experience perspective.
d) Additional review channel.

Please let me know your thoughts.
Looking forward for a positive response and hence with a mutually
beneficial partnership.

Regards,
Ravi 
Co-founder, Nativebag.in

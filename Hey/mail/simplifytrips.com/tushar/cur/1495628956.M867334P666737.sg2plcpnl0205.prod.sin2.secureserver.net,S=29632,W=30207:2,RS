Dear Tushar,

Thanks for your reply.
I missed asking you - What are the number of customers we can get on an
average if we see on a per week or per 15 days basis ? How you divide
volume of customers on budget , middle and Luxury holidays ...give me
percentage wise.

Correct answers to above will help us associate with your company.

Thanks
Regards
Shantanu

son:- =C2=A0 You or any local expert are free to upload your listings as pe=
r your choice , if you feel that ladakh package is not worth uploading you =
can upload your package of any other destination. but since its a peak seas=
on for leh-ladakh , local experts preferred to upload ladakh packages. But =
you can still edit/delete your uploaded package at any point you feel.<br>Y=
ou can also check for destinations such as Goa, srinagar, rishikesh, kochi,=
 dharamshala, dalhousie, udaipur etc.</p>
<p>Q2 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 If some clients shows interest in your pa=
ckage.....??<br>Reason:- =C2=A0 If some client shows interest in your packa=
ge they will directly contact you and you can close that deal by offering t=

Dear Tushar

Thanks for your mail and offer.
Someone called me yesterday and after that I had checked your portal to see
the kinds of packages in offer. However, I found the trips are available
for Ladakh only..rest of the destination are not seen in the offer.

Secondly, what happens if some clients shows interest in our package shown
on your portal,

*which becomes a lead for us and later he does not travel with us which is
very common among Indian Tourists. *

*What about the costs etc which you would charge ? *

Your email says the following which is copied below with my questions
embedded -

*Proposal:*
- Based on the travel location searched by our travelers, we offer them
options to compare and choose their packages from various local experts.
- As a start-up offer, you are entitled for up-to 20 free listings for your
packages(i.e. 10 Domestic & 10 International) under any category. There are
hardly any packages seen !!
- You can edit/delete these trips according to your needs.


*Whats in it for Exotic India Journey ?*
a) Customer satisfaction as a trusted partner of simplifytrips.com.
b) You can negotiate directly with travelers without our involvement.
c) You as a service provider and your packages will be reviewed by
travelers, more positive reviews about you, top place you will get in our
listings page as "most recommended package". How can offer Top Place when
there are similar packages by other Travel Companies also ?
d) Exposure to the untapped audience.
e) "Zero Commission" structure for bookings through us.


Thanks

Regards

Shantanu

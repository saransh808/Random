Dear Sakshi,

We found you on interndesk and would like to know more about you. 
Yesterday we tried reaching you but couldn't as you were busy. Kindly 
share your updated resume/CV so that we can know more about your skills 
and past experience. Also mention a suitable time to contact your over 
call. If you like to gain experience in how a startup works with various 
challenges & pressure and if you could perform well under this 
atmosphere we would like to have you on-board.

Also mention your availability for face to face interview.

For any queries , do reply.

HR,

son:- =C2=A0 You or any local expert are free to upload your listings as pe=
r your choice , if you feel that ladakh package is not worth uploading you =
can upload your package of any other destination. but since its a peak seas=
on for leh-ladakh , local experts preferred to upload ladakh packages. But =
you can still edit/delete your uploaded package at any point you feel.<br>Y=
ou can also check for destinations such as Goa, srinagar, rishikesh, kochi,=
 dharamshala, dalhousie, udaipur etc.</p>
<p>Q2 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 If some clients shows interest in your pa=
ckage.....??<br>Reason:- =C2=A0 If some client shows interest in your packa=
ge they will directly contact you and you can close that deal by offering t=
he deal you like. We are not a booking platform, we are a meta-search engin=
e to help travelers search their packages.</p>
<p>Q3 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 What we will charge......??<br>Ans:- =C2=A0 =C2=
=A0We have a &quot;ZERO COMMISSION&quot; structure, so you can sit back and=
 relax , we -won&#39;t be charging any commission from you, we will only be=
 charging a small amount for the number of packages you upload with us.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Q4 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Start-up Offer (20 listings)<br>Ans :- =C2=A0 As =

th us<br>irrespective of the category. After 2 months of free listings we w=
ill be intimating you about the charges for the listings.</p>
<p>Q5 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0How you can rank up.....??<br>Ans:- As of now the=
 sorting part is not bound to rating condition, in our next up-gradation of=

isting which was done first by the local expert will be given preference an=
d so on. =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0-</p>

</div></div><p>Dear Shantanu,</p>
<p>First of all sorry for not addressing your query the previous day, as i =
was out of the office. Kindly below the response to your queries.</p>
<p>Number of visitors:- Since we are a startup and are in a phase of growin=
g our site visitor base, at this point of time we can not commit/guarantee/=
quote any number of visitors. We would love to share our first month report=
 with you in which we had<span>=C2=A0700+ sessions with an average session =
duration of more than 03:00 minutes through more than 1350 page views from =
about 350 unique visitors. The probability of a customer/client reaching yo=
u depends on the deal offered by you or any local expert.</span></p>
<p><span>Categorization of trips:- As of now only budget trip category is o=
pen which is aimed to cheap trip packages. There is as no such percentage w=
ise division of listings coz , for some of the travelers the luxury trip co=
uld be a budget trip according to their expectancy level and pocket size, y=
ou have to decide which particular segment you are targeting.=C2=A0=C2=A0</=
span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span>I hope i have satisfied your queries, but still if you feel someth=

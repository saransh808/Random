Dear Himani,

  Since you didn't turned up for the interview even after confirming the 
same from your end and didn't even responded to the calls, we have to 
assume that your priorities have changed and your application for online 
market intern with simplifytrips is hereby cancelled. You should have 
informed us during the call that you will not be coming for the 
interview instead of asking for the address.


We wish you best of luck for your future and hope you stick to all your 
future commitments.


WBR

HR,

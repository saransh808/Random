Dear Sandro, 

Thank you for updating me of my submission with IAN. I would like you
take a year back to Feb 2016 when i shared a proposition with titled as
"Wedlock". After few months of my submission NDTV launched their venture
bandbaajaa.com and an other startup weddingplz.com launched in the same
year which is similar to what i have submitted. But the response what i
got from IAN (from Ms bhagat was :- Interesting proposition but early
for investment). As that plan was a very large scale plan to execute i
dropped it and went on with my simplifytrips project. In a whole what i
want to convey is that either the proposition which i share with you
can't convey the basic thought/idea of the startup or the presentation
is not being evaluated properly, and that is why i insist on a face to
face meeting. I do understand the fact that you receive too many
applications that sometimes it is not possible to evaluate each and
every startup properly.

That was nice to connect with you, hoping

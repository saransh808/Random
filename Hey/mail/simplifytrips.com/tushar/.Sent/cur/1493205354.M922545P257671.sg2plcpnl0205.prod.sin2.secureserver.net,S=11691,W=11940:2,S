Dear Tushar, +Co-founder, Bharath.

Below is the tentative plan for the Phase I launch:
STEP 1: Discuss options to integrate [Dedicated/Integrated Payment
model] (Target: End of this week?)
Nativebag to send the snapshots of the target plugin look and placement.
Finalize locations to target as Phase I launch; Top revenue making
locations for SimplifyTrips.com.
We can get into a conference call. Please let me know the best time for
a call tomorrow.
STEP 2: Implemement/Finalize the NB Plugin based on the customization
needs. (Duration: ~2 weeks)
2 A) SimplifyTrips.com to share, if any APIs to push the content to
their PNR/ticketing system with the Nativebag order.
STEP 3: Integration and Staging (Duration: 1 week)
STEP 4: Launch (Can we target May end?)

Note: All the above plans are indicative and just to move forward. We
would be definitely looking for your inputs to amend.

Please let me know your thoughts. 
We would love to meet in person, but we seem based out a little far now.
:)

Regards,
Ravi

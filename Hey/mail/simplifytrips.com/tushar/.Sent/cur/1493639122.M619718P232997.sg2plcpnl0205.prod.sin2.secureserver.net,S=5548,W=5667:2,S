Dear Anamika, 

Thanks for reaching out to me with this input from your end. Allow me to
bring this fact to your kind notice that if a minimum stipend has to be
given then in that case I would have hired a permanent (experienced)
employee. The interns will work either for 60/45/30 days (as mentioned
in their academic curriculum) and they will be least beneficial for our
organization. Many companies such as Amul etc (With whom I did my
internship) didn't paid any stipend to me. You must be aware of how many
companies pays stipend during the internship program. We are a start-up
and are bootstrapped. It would not be possible for us to pay any fixed
amount. Allowing internships is kind of a mutual offering from both ends
and doesn't always requires to be paid.

If you feel that this reply would not be sufficient for the query
raised, its my humble request to kindly delete all the internships and
my profile too from your database. 

That was nice in signing up with Internshala.

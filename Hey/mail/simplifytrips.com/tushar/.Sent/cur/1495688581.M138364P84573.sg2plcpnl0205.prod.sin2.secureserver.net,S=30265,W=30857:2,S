Dear Shantanu , 

We are pleased to address each and every query of yours one by one:- 

Q1           Trips for ladakh only....??
Reason:-   You or any local expert are free to upload your listings as
per your choice , if you feel that ladakh package is not worth uploading
you can upload your package of any other destination. but since its a
peak season for leh-ladakh , local experts preferred to upload ladakh
packages. But you can still edit/delete your uploaded package at any
point you feel.
You can also check for destinations such as Goa, srinagar, rishikesh,
kochi, dharamshala, dalhousie, udaipur etc. 

Q2         If some clients shows interest in your package.....??
Reason:-   If some client shows interest in your package they will
directly contact you and you can close that deal by offering the deal
you like. We are not a booking platform, we are a meta-search engine to
help travelers search their packages. 

Q3       What we will charge......??
Ans:-    We have a "ZERO COMMISSION" structure, so you can sit back and
relax , we -won't be charging any commission from you, we will only be
charging a small amount for the number of packages you upload with us. 

Q4      Start-up Offer (20 listings)
Ans :-   As a startup offer you can upload 10 domestic and 10
international listings with us
irrespective of the category. After 2 months of free listings we will be
intimating you about the charges for the listings. 

Q5      How you can rank up.....??
Ans:- As of now the sorting part is not bound to rating condition, in
our next up-gradation of our portal , the listings will be bound to the
ratings given by users, if at any condition two or more than two
listings gets same ratings then the listing which was done first by the
local expert will be given preference and so on.              - 

I hope your queries have been addressed, but if you still have doubt,
you can revert to me without any hesitation.

Dear Shantanu, 

First of all sorry for not addressing your query the previous day, as i
was out of the office. Kindly below the response to your queries. 

Number of visitors:- Since we are a startup and are in a phase of
growing our site visitor base, at this point of time we can not
commit/guarantee/quote any number of visitors. We would love to share
our first month report with you in which we had 700+ sessions with an
average session duration of more than 03:00 minutes through more than
1350 page views from about 350 unique visitors. The probability of a
customer/client reaching you depends on the deal offered by you or any
local expert. 

Categorization of trips:- As of now only budget trip category is open
which is aimed to cheap trip packages. There is as no such percentage
wise division of listings coz , for some of the travelers the luxury
trip could be a budget trip according to their expectancy level and
pocket size, you have to decide which particular segment you are
targeting.   

I hope i have satisfied your queries, but still if you feel something is
still unclear you can revert me anytime.

eason:- &nbsp; You or any local expert are free to upload your listings as =
per your choice , if you feel that ladakh package is not worth uploading yo=
u can upload your package of any other destination. but since its a peak se=

t you can still edit/delete your uploaded package at any point you feel.<br=
 />You can also check for destinations such as Goa, srinagar, rishikesh, ko=
chi, dharamshala, dalhousie, udaipur etc.</p>

was out of the office. Kindly below the response to your queries.</p>
<p>Number of visitors:- Since we are a startup and are in a phase of growin=
g our site visitor base, at this point of time we can not commit/guarantee/=
quote any number of visitors. We would love to share our first month report=
 with you in which we had<span>&nbsp;700+ sessions with an average session =
duration of more than 03:00 minutes through more than 1350 page views from =
about 350 unique visitors. The probability of a customer/client reaching yo=
u depends on the deal offered by you or any local expert.</span></p>
<p><span>Categorization of trips:- As of now only budget trip category is o=
pen which is aimed to cheap trip packages. There is as no such percentage w=
ise division of listings coz , for some of the travelers the luxury trip co=
uld be a budget trip according to their expectancy level and pocket size, y=
ou have to decide which particular segment you are targeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</=
span></p>
<p><br /></p>

Hi Tushar
I reached at the address given, but because there was no office in A7 1st
floor Manhattan building, and even the guards there didn't know if there is
any office, I came back.

I saw your calls right now. And, I think there might have been some mistake
in the address only provided in the mail and told by you over phone.

Still I am sorry for any inconvenience caused.

Best,
Himani Verma

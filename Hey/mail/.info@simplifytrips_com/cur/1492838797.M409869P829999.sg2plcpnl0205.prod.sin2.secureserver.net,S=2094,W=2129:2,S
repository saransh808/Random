I am Emma Bowles (Marketing consultant). I stumbled upon your website and realized that despite having a good design, your website is not ranking on any of the search engines with most of the business oriented keywords. I was wondering if you would be interested to optimization and social media promotion of your website.

All of our practices are “White Hat Techniques” and we strictly follow Google Webmasters Guidelines to promote our clients’ websites online. I will suggest some traffic generating keywords as per the principles of Search Engine Optimization.

If you are interested, then I can send you our past work details, company information and an affordable quotation. Please email us back to get detail.

Warm Regards,
Emma Bowles"

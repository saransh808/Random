  Hope you are doing well.

We just wanted to follow up with you on our last mail sent regarding
sign-up.
Sorry for being overly persistent but we believe your company is an
awesome fit to what we offer and would love to help your business grow.

 We would appreciate if you can help us with a one liner even if it is
"I am not interested" just to make sure that our mails aren't getting
caught in your spam filter.

WBR
